# AI-Powered Hospital Readmission Risk Prediction

## Project Overview

Hospital readmissions contribute significantly to healthcare costs and patient burden, especially among chronic diseases like diabetes. This project develops an end-to-end AI-powered solution to predict 30-day readmission risk for diabetic patients using real-world healthcare data. The solution integrates cloud data warehousing, machine learning, explainability, generative AI reporting, and automation â€” simulating a full-stack data science application relevant for real-world healthcare operations.

This project is designed as a production-grade portfolio case study, demonstrating capabilities across **data engineering, machine learning, AI integration, and cloud automation**.

## Business Problem

> Can we proactively identify diabetic patients at risk of being readmitted within 30 days of discharge? Early identification of high-risk patients allows healthcare providers to allocate resources, intervene earlier, and potentially improve patient outcomes.

## Solution Highlights

- **Cloud Data Engineering**: Data ingestion, cleansing, and transformation using Snowflake.
- **Machine Learning**: Predictive models trained using Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression.
- **Explainable AI**: SHAP-based feature attribution to generate clinically interpretable explanations.
- **Generative AI**: GPT-powered narrative summaries translating predictions into natural language risk assessments for clinicians.
- **Automation Pipelines**: Full end-to-end data orchestration with Prefect.
- **Deployment**: Interactive web application using Streamlit for real-time prediction, explainability, and report generation.

## Machine Learning Approach

- **Preprocessing**: Missing value handling, feature encoding, outlier removal
- **Feature Engineering**: Derived features using Snowflake SQL & Python
- **Models Evaluated**:
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - XGBoost Classifier
  - Logistic Regression (baseline)
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - ROC-AUC
  - F1-Score
  - Precision-Recall Curve

## Explainable AI

> In healthcare, model transparency is critical. SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) is used to quantify each featureâ€™s contribution to an individual patientâ€™s readmission risk, enhancing model trust and clinical interpretability.

---

## Generative AI Integration

- **Objective**: Translate model predictions into doctor-friendly risk assessment summaries.
- **Tool**: OpenAI GPT-4o API with LangChain orchestration
- **Example Output**:

> "Based on the patient's medical history, recent lab results, and medication adjustments, the predicted likelihood of readmission within 30 days is 72%. Key contributing factors include prior emergency visits, insulin regimen changes, and elevated A1C levels."
